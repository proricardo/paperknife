PaperKnife is a professional-grade, open-source PDF utility designed with a "Zero-Server Architecture." Unlike other PDF tools that require you to upload sensitive documents to a remote server, PaperKnife performs every operation directly in your device's memory.

Your data never leaves your phone.

Core Features:

• Merge PDF: Combine multiple documents into one.
• Split PDF: Visually extract specific pages or ranges.
• Compress PDF: Reduce file size without sacrificing quality.
• Protect & Unlock: Add or remove passwords with strong encryption.
• Convert: Images to PDF and PDF to high-quality images.
• Edit: Rotate, rearrange, and add page numbers or watermarks.
• Secure: Edit metadata and sign documents electronically.

Built for the community, PaperKnife is fully open-source (AGPLv3) and contains no tracking, no analytics, and no advertisements. It's the ultimate tool for those who value their document privacy.

Note: This "Lite" store version excludes non-free Deep OCR binaries for FOSS compliance. Users who require full OCR support and advanced text extraction can download the Full Version directly from our GitHub repository.
