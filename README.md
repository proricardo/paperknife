## 🛡️ Why PaperKnife?

Most PDF tools upload your sensitive documents to a cloud server to process them. This means your bank statements, contracts, and medical records leave your device.

**PaperKnife is different.**
It runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly. Your files **never** leave your device's memory. You can even turn off your Wi-Fi and use it offline.
