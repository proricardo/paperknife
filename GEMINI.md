# 🧠 GEMINI.md - The PaperKnife "Chameleon" Brain

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **CRITICAL MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL:** 
> 1. DONT ADD UNLESS ITS SOMETHING IMPORTANT OR WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THE FUTURE YOU. 
> 2. THINK TWICE BEFORE REMOVING/REPLACING INFO; YOU MIGHT DELETE IMPORTANT DATA.
> 3. NEVER use `grep` via `run_shell_command`. Always use the provided `search_file_content` tool for searching code.

## 🛡️ 1. Privacy Protocol (THE GOLDEN RULE)
* **Zero-Server Architecture:** PaperKnife is 100% client-side. No PDF data ever leaves the device.
* **No Analytics/Telemetry:** The app must never include tracking scripts or external pings.
* **Local Processing:** All PDF manipulation (Merging, Splitting, Compression) is performed via `pdf-lib` in the browser's memory or the APK's WebView.
* **Data Persistence:** If the user "saves" progress, it must be stored in the browser's `IndexedDB` or `LocalStorage`, never a cloud database.

## 🎭 2. Chameleon Mode & Previews
* **One Codebase, Two Souls:**
    * **Web View:** A "Bento Grid" dashboard. High-density information, desktop-optimized. Hosted on GitHub Pages.
    * **Android View:** A "Native-Style" app. Bottom navigation bar, thumb-friendly buttons, full-screen focus. Built as an APK.
* **Live Simulation:** The project includes a `viewMode` state (`web` | `android`). 
    * In `npm run dev`, a floating toggle (bottom-right) allows switching views instantly to test the "Chameleon" shift. This toggle is protected by `import.meta.env.DEV` and is invisible in production.

## 🚀 3. Final Products & Deployment
1.  **Web Version:** Built via Vite and auto-pushed to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
2.  **Android APK:** Wrapped via Capacitor. The APK is compiled using GitHub Actions (`create-android.yml`) so the user can download it from GitHub "Releases."

## 🏗️ 5. Architectural Notes
*   **Chameleon Engine:** Uses `viewMode` state in `App.tsx` to hot-swap between `WebView.tsx` and `AndroidView.tsx`.
*   **Routing:** Uses `react-router-dom` with a `/PaperKnife/` basename for GitHub Pages compatibility.
*   **PDF Core:** `pdf-lib` handles all manipulation. **Note:** Always use the `degrees()` helper for rotation.
*   **Background Workers:** Use `src/utils/pdfWorker.ts` for CPU-intensive PDF tasks to keep the UI responsive.
*   **UI Components:** 
    *   `src/components/tools/shared/`: Centralized Tool UI components.
    *   `src/utils/pdfHelpers.ts`: High-level wrappers for pdf-lib and pdfjs-dist.
*   **State Management:** IndexedDB (via `recentActivity.ts`) stores the last 10 processed file metadata locally.

## 🧱 6. Tool Development Checklist (For Future Gemini)
*   **Base Layout:** Wrap tools in `<div className="flex-1">` and use `<main className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-6 md:py-10">`.
*   **Shared UI:** Use `<ToolHeader>`, `<SuccessState>`, and `<PrivacyBadge>` in every tool.
*   **Toasts:** Use `toast` from `sonner` instead of standard alerts.
*   **Security:** If a tool processes a locked file, display a "Security Note" (amber box) regarding unprotected output.

## 🛠️ 7. Technical Quirks (CRITICAL)
*   **pdf-lib Encryption Bug:** Use a `try/catch` retry pattern. If the first load fails, retry with `{ password, ignoreEncryption: true }`.
*   **PDF.js Worker:** Import via: `import pdfWorker from 'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs?url'`.
*   **CMap Paths:** Always point `cMapUrl` to `/PaperKnife/cmaps/` for local font support.

## ⚠️ 8. Critical Dev Notes (Maintenance)
*   **TypeScript Strictness:** Project uses `--max-warnings 0`. Unused imports or props WILL break the build.
*   **Rollup Chunking:** `vite.config.ts` uses `manualChunks` to split `pdf-lib` and `pdfjs-dist`.
*   **Worker URL:** Always use `new URL('../../utils/pdfWorker.ts', import.meta.url)` for worker instantiation in Vite.

---
**Current Goal:** Maintenance of v1.0.0 and gathering community feedback for the final v1.1 evolution.
